## Analysis

Once opened, the document looks like this:

![](/pics-set1/img8.png)

In my opinion, not much work was put into crafting the actual document, but who am I to judge?

When you enable content, you'd get this error message:

![](/pics-set1/img1.png)

This isn't a makeshift error message crafted by the attacker as a social engineering tactic (as I did [here ;) ](https://github.com/1d8/pysock)) but rather an actual error message since the file they attempt to download & execute (named **Filename.exe**) doesn't actually download.

After enabling content & letting the macros run, we open Procmon's process tree & we can see that powershell is used to *attempt* to drop the main malware (ignore all the notepad.exe noise, that was all generated by me):

![](/pics-set1/img2.png)

The full powershell command used by the macro is here:

![](/pics-set1/img3.png)

As we can see, it executes it in a hidden window & uses the *bypass* flag in order to bypass any protections a user has set up in order to prevent execution of unauthorized scripts (I may be incorrect, but I believe this method only works if the user is running with admin level privileges).

The powershell also drops the file to disk & saves it in the Temp directory as **Filename.exe** as we seen earlier & then executes it.

The url used is hxxps://tinyurl.com/ybz4nnyg. Tinyurl is a url shortener which will redirect to the main website. Attempting to navigate to this tinyurl yields no response, which likely means whatever site this malware was hosted as has since been taken down.

The final payload that would've been grabbed if the url was still up would be the RemcosRAT

My claim of the URL no longer being up is backed by the powershell logs:

![](/pics-set1/img4.png)

If you wish to receive the powershell code without actually running it the way the attackers intended, simply edit the code and delete the Shell() command & add in a variable, then print that variable in a message box:

Before:

![](/pics-set1/img5.png)

After:

![](/pics-set1/img6.png)

Result after running:

![](/pics-set1/img7.png)
